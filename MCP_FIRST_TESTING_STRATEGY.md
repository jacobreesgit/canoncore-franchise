# MCP-First Testing Strategy for CanonCore

**Phase 7a: MCP Development Environment Setup** ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Philosophy: Interactive Development Testing

CanonCore adopts **MCP-First Development** using Microsoft's Playwright MCP server for live, conversational testing during development sessions. This approach replaces traditional static test files with real-time, AI-assisted browser automation.

## What MCP-First Development Means

### ❌ Traditional Approach (What We Avoid)
- Writing static test files (.spec.ts, .test.ts)
- Manual test execution via npm run commands  
- Separate testing phase disconnected from development
- Pre-written test scenarios that become outdated
- Batch testing with delayed feedback

### ✅ MCP-First Approach (Our Method)
- **Live Browser Automation**: Claude controls the browser during development conversations
- **Real-Time Testing**: Issues discovered and fixed immediately in context
- **Visual Feedback**: Screenshots and UI inspection provide instant validation
- **Context-Aware Testing**: Testing adapts to current development focus
- **Interactive Debugging**: Live problem-solving as issues arise

## Core MCP Workflow

### 1. Development Setup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start CanonCore development server
npm run dev                    # Standard development (real Google OAuth)
# OR
npm run dev:emulator          # Emulator development (test users Alice/Bob)

# Terminal 2: Start Firebase emulators (for emulator mode)
npm run emulator:start

# Terminal 3: Start MCP server
npm run mcp:start

# Claude Code conversation begins...
```

### 2. Conversational Testing Examples

#### Authentication Flow Testing
```
User: "Test the Google OAuth sign-in process"

Claude: "I'll navigate to your app and test the authentication flow."
[MCP: Navigate to localhost:3000]
[MCP: Click "Sign In with Google"]
[MCP: Take screenshot of OAuth flow]
[MCP: Verify authentication state after sign-in]
[MCP: Test protected route access]

Claude: "Authentication flow is working correctly. I found one issue with the loading spinner that appears briefly. Here's a screenshot..."
```

#### Form Validation Testing
```
User: "Check the universe creation form validation"

Claude: "I'll test the form with various input scenarios."
[MCP: Navigate to /universes/create]
[MCP: Submit empty form to test required field validation]
[MCP: Test character limits and input sanitization]
[MCP: Fill valid form and verify submission]
[MCP: Take screenshots of error states and success state]

Claude: "Form validation is working well. The error messages are clear and accessible. One suggestion: the description field could benefit from a character counter."
```

#### Responsive Design Testing
```
User: "Test the mobile navigation system"

Claude: "I'll test the responsive navigation across different viewports."
[MCP: Set viewport to mobile (375x667)]
[MCP: Test hamburger menu functionality]
[MCP: Navigate through mobile menu options]
[MCP: Set viewport to tablet (768x1024)]
[MCP: Test intermediate breakpoint behavior]
[MCP: Take screenshots at each viewport]

Claude: "Mobile navigation works smoothly. The hamburger menu is accessible and all links function correctly across viewports."
```

## Phase 7b: Firebase Auth Emulator Integration ✅

### Key Learnings & Critical Insights

**Environment Variable Management:**
- Environment variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access in Next.js
- Changes to `.env.local` require full development server restart to take effect
- Use command-based emulator mode (`npm run dev:emulator`) rather than permanent environment file changes

**MCP Browser Cache Management:**
- **Critical Discovery**: MCP browser automation requires explicit cache clearing for reliable testing
- Standard browser refresh doesn't clear necessary caches for environment variable changes
- Must implement comprehensive cache clearing equivalent to Chrome DevTools "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
- Essential for Firebase configuration changes and environment variable updates

**Firebase Auth Emulator Best Practices:**
- Emulator provides fast, offline authentication testing without rate limits
- Consistent test users (Alice Test User, Bob Test User) enable predictable testing scenarios
- Hybrid approach optimal: emulator for development speed, real OAuth for production validation
- Emulator data persistence enables consistent test scenarios across development sessions

**TypeScript Integration Issues:**
- Auth context type definitions must support optional parameters for emulator test users
- Interface updates required: `signIn: (testUser?: { email: string; displayName: string }) => Promise<void>`
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Google OAuth flow (no parameters)

**Development Workflow Optimization:**
```bash
# Standard development (real Google OAuth)
npm run dev

# Emulator development (Alice/Bob test users) 
npm run dev:emulator

# Firebase emulators (separate terminal)
npm run emulator:start
```

**Hydration Mismatch Prevention:**
- Server-side rendering must exactly match client-side rendering
- Dynamic content (version numbers, timestamps) can cause SSR/client mismatches
- Convert client components to server components when possible to eliminate hydration issues

### Updated MCP Testing Workflow

1. **Start development environment** (choose one):
   - `npm run dev` (real Google OAuth)
   - `npm run dev:emulator` (test users Alice/Bob)

2. **Start Firebase emulators** (if using emulator mode):
   - `npm run emulator:start`

3. **Start MCP server**:
   - `npm run mcp:start`

4. **Test with comprehensive cache clearing** when needed:
   - Environment variable changes require MCP cache clearing
   - Firebase configuration changes require cache clearing
   - Equivalent to manual "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

This integrated approach enables rapid development cycles with reliable, automated testing through conversational AI interaction.

### Phase 7b: Complete Authentication Testing ✅

**Comprehensive MCP Authentication Validation:**
- ✅ **Protected Route Redirections**: Unauthenticated users properly redirected from `/universes/create` to `/`
- ✅ **Emulator Sign-In Flow**: Alice Test User authentication successful with immediate dashboard access
- ✅ **Protected Route Access**: Authenticated users can access `/universes/create` and see full form interface
- ✅ **User Profile Navigation**: Profile pages accessible with user-specific URLs (`/profile/YAefay5HuJimdE2BSB4EnfuXfwla`)
- ✅ **Sign-Out Functionality**: Complete session cleanup with proper redirect to sign-in page
- ✅ **Session Persistence Verification**: Post-signout attempts to access protected routes properly blocked

**Key Decision Updated: Real Google OAuth Primary Method**
After comprehensive Phase 7c testing, real Google OAuth is the primary testing method:
- **Full Functionality**: All dynamic routes work correctly (universes, profiles, content)
- **Complete Coverage**: No limitations with Next.js App Router SSR
- **Production Accuracy**: Testing matches actual user experience
- **MCP Compatibility**: Automated testing works perfectly with real authentication

**Firebase Emulator Limited Use Cases:**
- **Authentication Flow Testing**: Only when Google popup prevents MCP automation
- **Development Speed**: Rapid iteration for basic dashboard/form testing
- **Test Users**: Alice and Bob accounts for specific authentication scenarios
- **Critical Limitation**: Cannot test dynamic routes due to SSR incompatibility

### Phase 7c: Emulator Limitations Discovery ✅

**Critical Finding**: Firebase Auth Emulator has significant limitations with Next.js App Router SSR for dynamic routes.

**Firebase Emulator vs Real Google OAuth - Testing Matrix:**

| **Feature** | **Emulator** | **Real OAuth** | **Status** |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Dashboard & Navigation** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Full Support |
| **Universe Creation** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Full Support |
| **Universe Editing** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Full Support |  
| **Search Functionality** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Full Support |
| **Discover Page** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Full Support |
| **Universe Detail Pages** | ❌ 500 Error | ✅ Works | **OAuth Required** |
| **Profile Pages** | ❌ 500 Error | ✅ Works | **OAuth Required** |
| **Content Detail Pages** | ❌ 500 Error | ✅ Works | **OAuth Required** |
| **Universe Deletion** | ❌ No Access | ✅ Works | **OAuth Required** |
| **Favourites Toggle** | ✅ Works* | ✅ Works | Full Support |

*_Favourites work in emulator after browser cache clearing_

**✅ Firebase Emulator CAN Do:**
- Dashboard functionality - Universe listing, search, favourites management
- Static pages - Discover page, sign-in page
- Universe creation - Full form validation and submission
- Universe editing - Form pre-population and updates (edit page works)
- Authentication flow - Sign in/out with test users (Alice, Bob)
- Firestore operations - All database CRUD operations
- Search functionality - Real-time filtering and empty states
- Basic navigation - All static routes and dashboard features

**❌ Firebase Emulator CANNOT Do (Need Real Google OAuth):**
- Dynamic route pages - `/universes/[id]` and `/profile/[userId]` (500 errors)
- Universe detail viewing - Cannot access individual universe pages
- Profile viewing - Cannot access user profile pages
- Content detail pages - `/content/[id]` (likely same SSR issue)
- Universe deletion testing - Requires access to universe detail page
- Profile editing - Requires access to profile pages
- Full end-to-end workflows - That involve dynamic route navigation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The 500 server errors on dynamic routes appear to be caused by:
1. **SSR + Emulator Mismatch**: Next.js App Router trying to server-render dynamic pages with emulator authentication state
2. **Authentication Context**: Server-side rendering failing to properly handle emulator test users
3. **Firebase SDK Compatibility**: Potential incompatibility between Firebase emulator and Next.js SSR

**Updated MCP Testing Strategy:**
- **Primary Testing Method**: Real Google OAuth for all functionality testing
- **Firebase Emulator**: Only for authentication flow testing (Google popup automation limitations)
- **Standard Workflow**: Use real Google OAuth for comprehensive testing of all features
- **Critical Discovery**: Firebase emulator incompatible with Next.js App Router SSR for dynamic routes

**Phase 7c Complete Universe Management Validation (Real OAuth):**
- ✅ **Universe Deletion**: Confirmation modal with proper warning text and cancel functionality
- ✅ **Favourites Management**: Real-time add/remove with immediate UI updates
- ✅ **Content Detail Pages**: Full metadata, hierarchical breadcrumbs, universe context
- ✅ **Profile Pages**: User profiles with statistics, favourites tabs, edit functionality
